Scholarship Hero – Aadhaar Seeding & Scholarship Access Portal
Why It Matters

Every year, thousands of students miss out on scholarships they deserve—not because they don’t qualify, but because the process is confusing. Aadhaar seeding, DBT-enabled accounts, endless deadlines—it can feel like a maze, especially for families with limited digital know-how.

That’s where Scholarship Hero steps in. Think of it as a guide, mentor, and support system rolled into one. It makes the scholarship process simple, accessible, and stress-free.

Help centers are hard to reach and information is scattered.
